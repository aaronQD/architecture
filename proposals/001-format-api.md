## Summary

This proposal introduces a dedicated API to easily figure out a file format.

While a `Publication` is independent of any particular format, knowing the format of a publication file is necessary to:

* determine the publication parser to use,
* group or search publications by file type in the user's bookshelf.

This API is not tied to `Publication`, so it can be used as a general purpose tool to guess a file format, e.g. during HTTP requests or in the LCP library.


## Motivation

* The way we handle formats is currently not unified across platforms.
* We don't have a documented strategy to determine the format of a file, which might cause differences across implementations.
* We are only using the media type and file extensions to determine the format, which is not enough in some cases, e.g. ZIP archives without extension.
* It's currently not easy for a reading app to support a custom publication format in Readium.
* Formats supported by Readium are currently exposed as enums with different cases on each platform, which is confusing.

```swift
// Swift
enum Publication.Format {
    /// Formats natively supported by Readium.
    case cbz, epub, pdf, webpub
    /// Default value when the format is not specified.
    case unknown
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin
enum class Publication.TYPE {
    EPUB, CBZ, FXL, WEBPUB, AUDIO, DiViNa
}
```


## Developer Guide

You can use the Format API every time you need to figure out the format of a file or bytes.

To use this API efficiently, you should:

* Never sniff a format from the UI thread, since it might perform IO operations. An assertion will check this.
* Provide file extension and media type hints when possible. If the sniffers manage to resolve a format from these hints, then the content won't be read.


### Sniffing the Format of Raw Bytes

You can use directly `Format.of()` for sniffing raw bytes (e.g. the body of an HTTP response). It will take a closure lazily returning the bytes.

```swift
let feedLink: Link
let response = httpClient.get(feedLink.href)

let format = Format.of(
    bytes: { response.body },
    // You can give several file extension and media type hints, which will be sniffed in order.
    fileExtensions: [feedLink.href.pathExtension],
    mediaTypes: [response.headers["Content-Type"], feedLink.type]
)
```

In the case of an HTTP response, this can be simplified by using the `HTTPResponse.sniffFormat()` extension:

```swift
let feedLink: Link
let response = httpClient.get(feedLink.href)

let format = response.sniffFormat(mediaTypes: [feedLink.type])
```

### Sniffing the Format of a File

For local files, you can provide an absolute path to `Format.of()`. To improve sniffing speed, you should also provide a media type hint if possible – for example if you previously stored it in a database.

```swift
let dbBook = database.get(bookId)

let format = Format.of(
    path: dbBook.path,
    mediaTypes: [dbBook.mediaType]
)
```

### Supporting a Custom Format

Reading apps are welcome to extend this API with their own formats. To declare a custom format, you need to:

1. Create a `Format` constant instance, optionally in the `Format.` namespace.
2. Create a sniffer function to recognize your format from a `Format.SnifferContext`.
3. Then, either:
    1. add your sniffer to the `Format.sniffers` shared list to be used globally,
    2. or use your sniffer on a case-by-case basis, by passing it to the `sniffers` argument of `Format.of()`.

Here's an example with Adobe's ACSM format.

```swift
// 1. Create the `Format` instance.
private let acsmFormat = Format(
    mediaType: MediaType("application/vnd.adobe.adept+xml"),
    name: "Adobe Content Server Manager",
    fileExtension: "acsm"
)

extension Format {
    static var ACSM: Format { acsmFormat }
}

// 2. Create the sniffer function.
func sniffACSM(context: Format.SnifferContext) -> Format? {
    if context.hasMediaType("application/vnd.adobe.adept+xml")
      || context.hasFileExtension("acsm")
      || context.contentAsXML?.documentElement?.localName == "fulfillmentToken"
    { 
        return Format.ACSM
    }

    return nil
}

// 3.1. Declare the sniffer globally.
Format.sniffers.add(sniffACSM)
let format = Format.of(path: acsmPath)

// 3.2. Or use the sniffer on a case-by-case basis. 
let format = Format.of(path: acsmPath, sniffers: Format.sniffers + [sniffACSM])
```

### Backward Compatibility and Migration

#### Swift

`Publication.format` and `Publication.formatVersion` will be deprecated, with a warning recommending to use `Format.of()` instead. They will still work as before so it's not a breaking change.

#### Kotlin

`Publication.type` and `Publication.version` will be deprecated, with a warning recommending to use `Format.of()` instead. They will still work as before so it's not a breaking change.


## Reference Guide

Instead of using directly a media type, we use a `Format` struct to identify a file format, for several reasons:

* A format such as CBZ can be identified by several media types.
* It's a convenient way to pair a media type and its name and file extension.

**We declare one `Format` per media type**, because if a given profile of a file format has its own media type, it means that it is worth differenciating for reading apps. However, if a recognized format doesn't have any unique media type (e.g. W3C WPUB), you can create one to use internally with Readium components, starting with the prefix `application/x.readium.`.

Resolving a `Format` from content or metadata is the job of the sniffers, which are functions with the type `Format.Sniffer`. Each supported `Format` must have at least one matching sniffer to be recognized. Therefore, a reading app should provide its own sniffers to support custom publication formats.


Here's an overview of the Format API:

* [`MediaType`](#mediatype-class) offers parsing and comparison of media types.
* [`Format`](#format-class) represents a known file format, uniquely identified by a media type.
* [`Format.Sniffer`](#formatsniffer-function-type) is a function type used to implement the sniffing algorithm of each format.


### `MediaType` class

Represents a string media type.

`MediaType` handles:

* components parsing – eg. type, subtype and parameters,
* media types comparison.

Comparing media types is more complicated than it looks, [since they can contain parameters](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838) such as `charset=utf-8`. We can't ignore them because some formats use parameters in their media type, for example `application/atom+xml;profile=opds-catalog` for an OPDS 1 catalog.

#### Constructor

* `MediaType(string: String)`
  * Creates a `MediaType` from its string representation.

#### Properties

* `type: String`
  * The type component, e.g. `application` in `application/epub+zip`.
* `subtype: String`
  * The subtype component, e.g. `epub+zip` in `application/epub+zip`.
* `parameters: Map<String, String>`
  * The parameters in the media type, such as `charset=utf-8`.
* `string: String` (or `toString()` if more idiomatic).
  * The canonical string representation of this media type.
    * Type, subtype and parameter names are lowercased.
    * Parameter values keep their original case, except for the `charset` parameter, which is uppercased.
    * Parameters are ordered alphabetically.
    * No spaces between parameters.
* `structuredSyntaxSuffix: String?`
  * Structured syntax suffix, e.g. `+zip` in `application/epub+zip`
  * Gives a hint on the underlying structure of this media type.
  * i.e. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838#section-4.2.8
* `encoding: Encoding?`
  * Encoding as declared in the `charset` parameter, if there's any.
  * Uses the standard `Encoding` type provided by the platform, for convenience.

#### Methods

* `contains(other: MediaType) -> Boolean`, `contains(other: String) -> Boolean`
  * Returns whether the provided `other` media type is included in this media type.
  * For example, `text/html` contains `text/html;charset=utf-8`.
  * `other` must match the parameters in the `parameters` property, but extra parameters are ignored. 
  * Parameters order is ignored. 
  * Wildcards are supported, meaning that `image/*` contains `image/png` and `*/*` contains everything.
* `matches(other: MediaType) -> Boolean`, `matches(other: String) -> Boolean`
  * Returns whether this media type and `other` are the same, ignoring parameters that are not in both media types.
  * For example, `text/html` matches `text/html;charset=utf-8`, but `text/html;charset=ascii` doesn't. This is basically like `contains`, but working in both directions.
* `==` (equality)
  * Returns whether two media types are equal, checking the type, subtype and parameters.
  * Parameters order is ignored.

#### Helpers

Computed properties for convenience. More can be added as needed.

* `isZIP: Boolean`
  * Returns whether this media type is structured as a ZIP archive.
* `isJSON: Boolean`
  * Returns whether this media type is structured as a JSON file.
* `isOPDS: Boolean`
  * Returns whether this media type is contained by `OPDS1`, `OPDS1Entry`, `OPDS2`, `OPDS2Publication` or `OPDSAuthentication`.
  * Used to determine the type of remote catalogs.
* `isHTML: Boolean`
  * Returns whether this media type is contained by `HTML` or `XHTML`.
  * Used to determine the type of remote catalogs.
* `isBitmap: Boolean`
  * Returns whether this media type is a bitmap image, so excluding SVG and other vectorial formats. It must be contained by `BMP`, `GIF`, `JPEG`, `PNG`, `TIFF` or `WebP`.
  * Used to determine if a RWPM is a DiViNa publication.
* `isAudio: Boolean`
  * Returns whether this media type is of an audio clip.
  * Used to determine if a RWPM is an Audiobook publication.
* `isRWPM: Boolean`
  * Returns whether this media type is a Readium Web Publication Manifest, so contained by `DiViNaManifest`, `ReadiumAudiobookManifest` or `ReadiumWebPubManifest`.
* `isLCPProtected: Boolean`
  * Returns whether this media type is of a package protected with LCP.

#### `Link` Helpers

* `mediaType: MediaType?`
  * Media type of the linked resource.
  * Equivalent to `MediaType(link.type)`.

### `Format` Class

Represents a known file format, uniquely identified by a media type.

#### Constructors

*Note: all of the constructor parameters are exposed as read-only public properties.*

* `Format(name: String, mediaType: MediaType, fileExtension: String)`
  * `name: String`
    * A human readable name identifying the format, which might be presented to the user.
  * `mediaType: MediaType`
    * The canonical media type that identifies the best (most officially) this format.
    * This might be stored in the reading app's database when importing a publication.
  * `fileExtension: String`
    * The default file extension to use for this format.

#### Methods

* `==` (equality)
  * Returns whether two formats have the same `mediaType`.
* (static) `of(mediaTypes: List<String> = [], fileExtensions: List<String> = [], sniffers: List<Sniffer> = Format.sniffers) -> Format?`
  * Resolves a format from file extension and media type hints, without checking the actual content.
  * (optional) `mediaTypes: List<String> = []`
    * Media type hints to be used by the sniffers.
    * We can provide several from different sources as fallbacks, e.g. from a `Link.type`, from a `Content-Type` HTTP header or from a database.
  * (optional) `fileExtensions: List<String> = []`
    * File extension hints to be used by the sniffers.
    * We can provide several from different sources as fallbacks, e.g. from a local path and a download URL.
  * (optional) `sniffers: List<Sniffer> = Format.sniffers`
    * List of content sniffers used to determine the format.
    * A reading app can support additional formats by giving `Format.sniffers + [customSniffer]`.
* (static) `ofFile(file: String, mediaTypes: List<String> = [], fileExtensions: List<String> = [], sniffers: List<Sniffer> = Format.sniffers) -> Format?`
  * Resolves a format from a local file path.
  * **Warning:** This API should never be called from the UI thread. An assertion will check this.
  * `file: String`
    * Absolute path to the file.
* (static) `ofBytes(bytes: () -> ByteArray, mediaTypes: List<String> = [], fileExtensions: List<String> = [], sniffers: List<Sniffer> = Format.sniffers) -> Format?`
  * Resolves a format from bytes, e.g. from an HTTP response.
  * **Warning:** This API should never be called from the UI thread. An assertion will check this.
  * `bytes: () -> ByteArray`
    * Closure lazy-loading the bytes.
    * Since the formats might be guessed from the provided file extensions or media types, we don't want to do eager loading, hence the closure.

#### Constants

* (static, writable) `sniffers: List<Sniffer>`
  * The default sniffers provided by Readium 2 to resolve a `Format`.
  * This list is writable, to allow reading apps to register additional sniffers globally, or remove sniffers.

Formats used by Readium are represented as static constants (singletons) on `Format`, for convenience.
Reading apps are welcome to extend the static constants with additional formats.

### `Format.Sniffer` Function Type

Determines if the provided content matches a known format.

#### Definition

* `Format.Sniffer = (context: Format.SnifferContext) -> Format?`
  * `context` holds the file metadata and cached content, which are shared among the sniffers.

### `Format.SnifferContext` Interface

A companion type of `Format.Sniffer` holding the type hints (file extensions, media types) and providing an access to the file content.

Examples of concrete implementations:

* `Format.FileSnifferContext` to sniff a local file.
* `Format.BytesSnifferContext` to sniff a bytes array.
* `Format.MetadataSnifferContext` to sniff only the media type and file extension hints.

#### Properties

* (private) `mediaTypes: List<String>`
  * Media type hints.
* (private) `fileExtensions: List<String>`
  * File extension hints.
* `encoding: Encoding?`
  * Finds the first `Encoding` declared in the media types' `charset` parameter.
  * Uses the standard `Encoding` type provided by the platform, for convenience.
* (lazy) `contentAsString: String?`
  * Content as plain text.
  * If needed, extract the `charset` parameter from the media type hints to figure out an encoding. Otherwise, fallback on UTF-8.
* (lazy) `contentAsXML: XMLDocument?`
  * Content as an XML document.
* (lazy) `contentAsZIP:  ZIPArchive?`
  * Content as a ZIP archive.
* (lazy) `contentAsJSON: JSONObject?`
  * Content as a JSON object.
* (lazy) `contentAsRWPM: Publication?`
  * Publication parsed from the content.

#### Methods

* `hasFileExtension(fileExtensions: String...) -> Boolean`
  * Returns whether this context has any of the given file extensions, ignoring case.
  * This will check the `fileExtensions` array.
* `hasMediaType(mediaTypes: String...) -> Boolean`, `hasMediaType(mediaTypes: MediaType...) -> Boolean`
  * Returns whether this context has any of the given media type, ignoring case and extra parameters.
  * This will check the `mediaTypes` array, using `MediaType` to handle the comparison.
* `stream() -> Stream?`
  * Raw bytes stream of the content.
  * A byte stream can be useful when sniffers only need to read a few bytes at the beginning of the file.
* `readFileSignature(length: Int, encoding: Encoding = UTF-8) -> String?`
  * Reads the file signature, aka magic number, at the beginning of the content, up to `length` bytes.
  * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures
* `close()`
  * Closes any opened file handles.

### HTTP Response Extension

It's useful to be able to resolve a format from an HTTP response. Therefore, implementations should provide when possible an extension to the native HTTP response type.

* `HTTPResponse.sniffFormat(mediaTypes: List<String> = [], fileExtensions: List<String> = [], sniffers: List<Sniffer> = Format.sniffers): Format?`
  * (optional) `mediaTypes`
    * Additional media type hints to be used by the sniffers.
  * (optional) `fileExtensions`
    * Additional file extension hints to be used by the sniffers.
  * (optional) `sniffers`
    * List of content sniffers used to determine the format.

This extension will create a `Format.BytesSnifferContext` using these informations:

* `mediaTypes`, in order:
  * the value of the `Content-Type` HTTP header,
  * additional provided `mediaTypes`, for example to use the value of `Link.type`.
* `fileExtensions`, in order:
  * the suggested filename extension, part of the HTTP header `Content-Disposition`,
  * the URL extension,
  * additional provided file extensions.
* `bytes`: the response's body


### Sniffing Strategy

It's important to have consistent results across platforms, so we need to use the same sniffing strategy.

Sniffing a format is done in two rounds, because we want to give an opportunity to all sniffers to return a `Format` quickly before inspecting the content itself:

1. **Light Sniffing** checks only the provided file extension or media type hints.
2. **Heavy Sniffing** reads the bytes to perform more advanced sniffing.

To do that, `Format.of()` will iterate over all the sniffers twice, first with a `Format.SnifferContext` containing only extensions and media types, and the second time with a context containing the content, if available.

#### Default Sniffers

Sniffers can encapsulate the detection of several formats to factorize similar detection logic. For example, the following sniffers were identified. The sniffers order is important, because some formats are subsets of others.

1. HTML
2. OPDS 1
3. OPDS 2
4. LCP License Document
5. Bitmap (BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF and WebP)
6. Readium Web Publication (WebPub, Audiobook, DiViNa, RWPM, LCPA and LCPDF)
7. W3C Web Publication
8. EPUB
9. LPF
10. Free-form ZIP (CBZ and ZAB)
11. PDF

In the case of bitmap formats, the default Readium sniffers don't perform any heavy sniffing, because we only need to detect these formats using file extensions in ZIP entries or media types in a manifest. If needed, a reading app could add additional sniffers doing heavy sniffing of bitmap files.
