## Summary

Our goal is to improve extensibility and customizability of the `Publication` type for reading apps. To achieve that, this proposal introduces two structured ways to extend a `Publication` with additional features: *helpers* and *services*.


## Motivation

### Computed Metadata

Readium components need to make decisions based on the metadata available in the `Publication`, which sometimes involves computing additional data. For example, it wouldn't make sense to show the font size setting for a full fixed-layout EPUB publication, so a `Publication::allReadingOrderIsFixedLayout` helper is useful.

These computed metadata are not part of [the core models specification](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/), so they should be added as extensions. Reading apps should be able to inject additional helpers to address custom needs.

[RWPM extensions](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/#8-extensibility) are already [implemented as helpers](https://github.com/readium/r2-shared-kotlin/blob/100914de22bbb8a8a95b7a718fffd32830d89396/r2-shared/src/main/java/org/readium/r2/shared/publication/presentation/Properties.kt) in the mobile toolkits, by converting JSON values to type-safe data structures.

### Swappable Implementations

For more complex and opiniated APIs, it would be useful to allow reading apps to swap Readium default implementations with their own. For example, calculating the [list of positions](https://github.com/readium/architecture/tree/master/models/locators/positions) can be done in [many different ways](https://github.com/readium/architecture/issues/123), and depends on the publication format.

By using a set of specified interfaces as contracts, we can have different Readium components use these services without caring for the concrete implementation.


## Developer Guide

The `Publication` shared models support extensibility through two structured ways: *helpers* and *services*.

* **Helpers are *internal* extensions**. They have a single implementation which is statically defined in the shared models.
* **Services are *external* extensions**. Other Readium components provide implementations, which are swappable and injected dynamically into the `Publication` object

### Publication Helpers

A *helper* extends the shared models by computing additional metadata when requested, such as:

  * `Presentation::layoutOf(Link)` returns the EPUB layout of a resource based on both publication and resource-level properties.
  * `List<Link>::allAreAudio` returns whether the collection of links contains only audio resources. When applied on `readingOrder`, it can be used to determine if the publication can be treated as an audiobook.

They are simple syntactic constructs, using the capabilities of each language, for example:

```swift
// Swift
extension Array where Element == Link {

    var allAreAudio: Bool {
        allSatisfy { $0.mediaType?.isAudio == true }
    }

}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin
val List<Link>.allAreAudio: Boolean get() = all {
    it.mediaType?.isAudio == true
}
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
LinkArray.prototype.everyAreAudio() = function() {
  return this.every(link => link.mediaType.isAudio())
};
```

### Publication Services

A *service* is a contract between Readium components, defined as an interface with swappable implementations stored in the `Publication` object, such as:

* [`Positions`](https://github.com/readium/architecture/tree/master/models/locators/positions) which splits a publication to provide a list of sequential locations.
* `Search` which provides a way to search a publication's content.

While the known service interfaces are defined in `r2-shared`, their implementations are usually provided by other components, such as `r2-streamer` or the reading app itself.

Publication services are a point of customizability for reading apps, because you can swap a default implementation with your own, or decorate it to add cross-cutting concerns. A reading app can also add custom service interfaces for internal needs.

#### Getting a Service Instance

The `Publication` object holds a list of service instances. To get an instance of a service, you can use `Publication::findService()`, which will return the first service implementing the interface `S`. However, you rarely need to access directly a service instance, since a service interface usually also defines helpers on `Publication` for convenience.

For example, the `PositionsService` declares the helper property `Publication::positions` to directly access the list of positions.

#### Consuming a Service on the Web

Some publication services expose a web version of their API, to be consumed for example by a JavaScript app or a remote client. In which case, you can retrieve the WS routes from `Publication::links`, using the WS custom media types or link relations. Then, the response can be fetched using `Publication::get()`, which can be exposed through HTTP with a Publication Server.

If the web service takes parameters, then its `Link` object will be [templated](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570).

The media types, formats and parameters depend on the specification of each publication service.

```javascript
let searchLink = publication.links.firstWithMediaType("application/vnd.readium.search+json")
// searchLink == Link(
//   href: "/~readium/search{?text}",
//   type: "application/vnd.readium.search+json",
//   templated: true
// )

if (searchLink) {
  // href == "/~readium/search?text=banana"
  let queryLink = searchLink.expandTemplate({"text": "banana"})
  // `results` is a JSON collection of Locator objects.
  let results = await publication.get(queryLink).readAsJSON()
}
```

#### Creating a New Service

To create your own service, you must declare:

* An interface inheriting from `Publication.Service`.
* At least one factory per concrete implementation of your service, with the type signature `Publication.Service.Factory`.

You should also provide *helpers* on `Publication` for a more convenient access to your service API, with fallbacks if no instances of your service is attached to the `Publication`.

Here's an example for `PositionsService`:

```kotlin
// The service contract.
interface PositionsService : Publication.Service {
    
    val positions: List<Locator>
    
}

// Defines a convenient `publication.positions` helper with a fallback value.
val Publication.positions: List<Locator> get() {
    val service = findService(PositionsService::class)
    return service?.positions ?: emptyList()
}


// A concrete implementation of the service.
class EPUBPositionsService(val readingOrder: List<Link>, val fetcher: Fetcher) : PositionsService {
    
    override val positions: List<Locator> by lazy {
        // Lazily computes the position list...
    }
    
    companion object {
        
        // The service factory.
        fun create(context: Publication.Service.Context): EPUBPositionsService {
            return EPUBPositionsService(context.manifest.readingOrder, context.fetcher)
        }
        
    }
}

val publication = Publication(manifest, fetcher, servicesBuilder = Publication.ServicesBuilder(
    positions = (EPUBPositionsService)::create
))
```

### Backward Compatibility and Migration

#### Mobile (Swift and Kotlin)

If you were providing your own implementation of the `PositionListFactory`, you will have to adapt it to use `PositionsService` instead.

The `Publication` models are not yet immutable in the Swift toolkit, which is required for this proposal to work properly. Since reading apps usually don't create or modify a `Publication`, this should have a minimal impact.


## Reference Guide

Helpers and services rely on the fact that a `Publication` is immutable. If that was not the case, then any cached value could become invalid.

### Publication Helpers

If a helper performs an expensive task, a warning should be logged if it is called from the UI thread. This is typically the case for helpers accessing resources from the `Fetcher`.

### Publication Services

#### `Publication.Service` Interface

Base interface to be inherited by all publication services.

##### Properties

* (optional) `links: List<Link>`
  * Links which will be added to `Publication::links`.
  * It can be used to expose a web API for the service, through `Publication::get()`.
  * To disambiguate the `href` with a publication's local resources, you **should** use the prefix `/~readium/`.
  * A custom media type or rel should be used to identify the service.
  * You can use a templated URI to accept query parameters.
  * e.g. `Link(href: "/~readium/search{?text}", type: "application/vnd.readium.search+json", templated: true)`

##### Methods

* (optional) `get(link: Link) -> Resource?`
  * Called by `Publication::get()` for each request. A service can return a `Resource` to:
    * respond to a request to its web API declared in `links`,
    * serve additional resources on behalf of the publication,
    * replace a publication resource by its own version.
  * Returns the `Resource` containing the response, or `null` if the service doesn't recognize this request.
* (optional) `close()`
  * Closes any opened file handles, removes temporary files, etc.
  * This is called by `Publication::close()`.

##### Copy and Factory

Since a service might cache values computed from the current manifest and fetcher, we can't reuse its instance when copying the `Publication` object. To circumvent this issue, the `Publication` is given service factories, which will be forwarded to its copies. During the construction of a `Publication` object, the provided factories are used to create the service instances.

```kotlin
typealias Publication.Service.Factory = (Publication.Service.Context) -> Publication.Service?

class Publication.Service.Context {
    val manifest: Manifest,
    val fetcher: Fetcher
}
```

A `Publication.Service.Context` is used instead of passing directly the arguments, to be able to add more parameters later on without modifying all the existing service factories.

#### `Publication` Additions

##### Methods

* `findService<T: Publication.Service>(serviceType: T::class): T?`
  * Returns the first publication service implementing the interface `T`.


## Rationale and Alternatives

Two alternatives to extend `Publication` were considered: decoration and inheritance.

### Decorating `Publication`

This doesn't require any change in the Readium toolkit. With this technique, the reading app creates a new type that will embed and proxy the `Publication` object, while adding more features.

While this solution is easy to implement, it doesn't allow customizing the behavior of Readium since other components are expecting a `Publication` object. 

### Subclassing `Publication`

We could allow the reading app to provide its own `Publication` subclass to the parsers. In this case, the reading app could override:

* `Publication::get()` to serve custom resources and web services,
* the default services exposed by Readium, for example `Publication::positions` 

Subclassing `Publication` might look more straightforward, but it could transform `Publication` into a bulky [god object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object). The solution introduced in this proposal has the advantage of offering a clear structure to encapsulate different services, and the possibility of swapping service implementations easily â e.g. the positions are computed differently for each publication format.


## Drawbacks and Limitations

* This proposal requires the `Publication` shared models to be immutable to work properly. Otherwise, we might end up with invalid lazy-cached values. While this is a limitation, having immutable models is generally considered safer.
* The publication helpers are added directly on the shared model types, which means that they are always available. This is convenient, but also means that we can have a `Publication` with irrelevant helpers. For example, `Properties.price` is always accessible, but only makes sense for an OPDS publication.


## Future Possibilities

Specifying new publication services and helpers should become a natural part of future proposals related to the `Publication` models.

### Transforming a Web Service into a Native Publication Service

We could encounter web publications served by a remote HTTP Streamer providing web services, such as a [positions list](https://github.com/readium/architecture/tree/master/models/locators/positions#manifest). In which case, a native toolkit might fetch the positions from the web service and convert them to in-memory `Locator` models, as a fallback if no instance of `PositionsService` is provided.

### Future Helpers?

* [Can I extract images for all resources](https://github.com/kobolabs/epub-spec#image-based-fxl-reader) in `readingOrder` from a full FXL publication?
* Is it a multi-lingual publication where [all or most resources have an equivalent in another language](https://readium.org/webpub-manifest/extensions/divina#3-alternate-resources) and if so, which languages are available?
* Which formats/bitrates/resolutions are available for an image-based/audio/video publication?

### Future Services?

* `SearchService` to search through a publication's content.
* `ContentProtectionService` to manage the DRM rights consumption.
* `ThumbnailsService` to generate and cache thumbnails for each resource/page in an EPUB FXL or DiViNa.
* `ReferenceService` to generate an index or glossary, or something akin to [Amazon X-Ray for Kindle](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G202187230).
* `ReflowService` to generate a reflowable view of fixed resources such as EPUB FXL or PDF.
* `UpdateService` to update a publication file from a remote server.
* `PackageService` to download and package a web publication to the file system.


## Appendix A: Services Provided by Readium

### `PositionsService`

Provides a list of discrete locations in the publication, no matter what the original format is.

This service is described in more details [in this specification](https://github.com/readium/architecture/tree/master/models/locators/positions). 

#### Properties

* (lazy) `positionsByReadingOrder: List<List<Locator>>`
  * List of all the positions in the publication, grouped by the resource reading order index.
* (lazy) `positions: List<Locator>`
  * List of all the positions in the publication.
  * Automatically derived from `positionsByReadingOrder`, if not implemented.

#### `Publication` Helpers

* `positionsByReadingOrder: List<Locator> = findService(PositionsService::class)?.positionsByReadingOrder ?: []`
* `positions: List<Locator> = findService(PositionsService::class)?.positions ?: []`

#### Web Service

`PositionsService` exposes the positions list as a web service.

It provides a default implementation to avoid rewriting the JSON serialization for all concrete implementations of `PositionsService`.

```kotlin
private const val positionsLink = Link(
    href = "/~readium/positions",
    type = "application/vnd.readium.position-list+json"
)

interface PositionsService : Publication.Service {

    /* List of all the positions in the publication as Locator objects. */
    val positions: List<Locator>

    /* List of all the positions in the publication, grouped by the resource reading order index. */
    val positionsByReadingOrder: List<List<Locator>>

    override val links: List<Link>
        get() = listOf(positionsLink)

    override fun get(link: Link): Resource? {
        if (link.href != positionsLink.href) {
            return null
        }

        val json = JSONObject().apply {
            put("total", positions.size)
            put("positions", positions.map { it.toJSON() })
        }
        return BytesResource(positionsLink, json.toString())
    }

}
```

### `CoverService`

Provides an easy access to a bitmap version of the publication cover.

While at first glance, getting the cover could be seen as a helper, the implementation actually depends on the publication format:

* Some might allow vector images or even HTML pages, in which case they need to be converted to bitmaps.
* Others require to render the cover from a specific file format, e.g. PDF.

Furthermore, a reading app might want to use a custom strategy to choose the cover image, for example by:

* Iterating through the `images` collection for a publication parsed from an OPDS 2 feed.
* Generating a bitmap from scratch using the publication's title.
* Using a cover selected by the user.

#### Properties

* `cover: Bitmap?`
  * Returns the publication cover as a bitmap at its maximum size.
  * If the cover is not in a bitmap format (e.g. SVG), the display's size is used.

#### Methods

* `coverFitting(maxSize: Size) -> Bitmap?`
  * Returns the publication cover as a bitmap, scaled down to fit the given `maxSize`.
  * If the cover is not in a bitmap format (e.g. SVG), it is exported as a bitmap filling `maxSize`.
  * The cover **should not** be cached in memory for next calls.

#### `Publication` Helpers

* `cover: Bitmap? = findService(CoverService::class)?.cover`
* `coverFitting(maxSize: Size) -> Bitmap? = findService(CoverService::class)?.coverFitting(maxSize)`

#### Web Service

If the cover selected by the `CoverService` is not already part of `Publication::links` with a `cover` relation, then the `CoverService` should add it to `CoverService::links` and serve the bitmap in `CoverService::get()` at the maximum available size. If the source format is a vector image, it will be fitted to the device's screen size.
